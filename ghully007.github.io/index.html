                            <p>Ninja Wars is a 2D game level which I developed using Unity and the C# programming language. The aim of this game level is to find and collect 30 coins without being killed by the enemy ninjas. Once you have collected all 30 coins, an animated portal should appear which you can exit through. Furthermore, I have animated all the ninjas in the game by utilising the animator in Unity, which gives the user a more effective gaming experience for when it comes to gameplay. As the player, you are able to execute various different combat actions. For example, as the player you can attack with a sword, throw spears and jump while attacking simultaneously.</p>
                            <br>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/ninjaprogramming.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>The enemy ninjas are controlled using artificial intelligence (AI) and can patrol, throw spears, attack using a sword and also follow you from a certain distance. Furthermore, the main camera follows the player around the game level, which provides the user with a more realistic and fun gaming experience during gameplay. In addition, the coins for this game level spawn randomly from the sky and land on the ground, whilst you are playing the game level which is more interesting for when it comes to gameplay, as you do not know where the next coin will land on the ground. The player is also immortal for a certain period of time, if the player is attacked concecutively. You will know if the player is immortal, as the player sprite will blink concecutively at a fast rate. Below you can play the game level, as I have embedded the game level into my website.</p>
                            <p>Keyboard Controls - A to move left, D to move right, J to jump, Space Bar to use the sword, T to throw the spears, J and Space Bar to use the sword while jumping.</p>

                            <p>UFO is a 2D game which I developed by using Unity and the C# programming language efficiently. This game is a one player game which incorporates simple but effective assets, which are a UFO spaceship, asteroids and a space themed background. The aim of the game is to evade all of the asteroids that you encounter, for when it comes to gameplay. In addition, if you evade a certain number of asteroids while playing the game then you will win. More so, the background is a moving background which scrolls in order to make the game look more realistic, for when it comes to gameplay.</p>

                            <p>As well as that, I have incorporated a power up within this game which enables the UFO spaceship to move at a faster rate for a certain period of time. Furthermore, the power up will only be activated if the UFO spaceship comes into contact and collides with the power up. The power up will also enable the game to be more challenging, as the UFO spaceship may be difficult to control while the power up is activated because you are moving at a faster rate, which increases the chances that the UFO spaceship will collide against an asteroid and get destroyed. To move the UFO spaceship, you hold down the space bar key on the keyboard of a PC/laptop to move the player game object up and down, for when it comes to playing the game effectively.</p>

                            <div class="col-lg-20 text-left">
                            <p>The maze is a 3D game which incorporates shapes as assets such as cuboids and spheres, which I used to develop this game. The aim of the game is to move the sphere, get through the maze and ensure that the sphere reaches the finishing square, without touching any of the green walls. If you move the sphere and touch the green walls, then the game will automatically restart and you will start the game from the very beginning. In addition, the green walls move to make the game more challenging, which will prevent you from reaching the finishing square. Some walls move from side to side and other walls expand from their original size and also then shrink back to their original size.</p>
                            <br>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/mazescript.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>Furthermore, I developed this game using Unity and the C# programming language, which I also exported as an Android Application Package (APK) after I accomplished the development of the game. This is the main reason I developed the game, as I wanted to make this game feel more realistic for when it comes to gameplay, which is why I also incorporated smartphone controls as well as keyboard controls. More specifically, for the smartphone controls I have incorporated an accelerometer which enables you to move and control the sphere by tilting the smartphone at different angles. In addition, the keyboard controls are W, A, S and D but also are the Up, Down, Left and Right arrow keys, which provides you with more flexibility when playing the game using the keyboard controls.</p>

                            <img src="img/portfolio/maze2.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>More so, I have also incorporated touch screen controls for when it comes to using a smartphone to play the game and also a game menu screen, before the game actually begins on the smartphone, as you can see below. The touch screen controls are used so that you can start the game from the game menu screen, so that you can restart the game from the very beginning without starting the game from the game menu screen again and so that you can return to the game menu screen from the actual gameplay. For the touch screen controls on the smartphone, you tap 'Play' on the game menu screen to start the game, you tap the screen simultaneously using two fingers from anywhere on the screen to restart the game and you tap 'Home' when playing the game, to return to the game menu screen before the game actually begins.</p>

                            <p>Aerial Combat is a 2D game which I developed using the Unity game engine and the C# programming language. In addition, this game was also one of my first year projects which I had achieved a first class in. Furthermore, the theme of this game is more related to World War 2 and specifically incorporates aerial combat, hence the name 'Aerial Combat'. The keyboard controls for this game are A and D to move the player plane left and right, F to fire bullets and R to fire missiles. As well as that, I have also incorporated Xbox 360 controls so that you are able to plug in an Xbox 360 controller into a PC/laptop via USB cable, allowing you to have an even more effective gaming experience. The Xbox 360 controls are the left joystick to move the player plane left and right, the RT button to fire bullets and the X button to fire missiles.</p>

                            <p>The aim of this game is to destroy enemy planes, bombers and missiles, by firing bullets and missiles of your own. In addition, this game incorporates four different waves of enemies, whereby each wave has a different number of enemies so the earlier waves have fewer enemies than the later waves. For each enemy you destroy you gain a score of 10 points and if you gain a score of 150 or more, without being destroyed yourself then you win the game. In addition, you have 3 lives and each time you get hit by either an enemy plane, bomber or missile, your lives get deducted. Then when your lives reach 0 you are destroyed and the game is over.</p>

                            <p>In this game I have also incorporated a power up mechanic and a firing cooling down mechanic. The power up mechanic enables you to fire missiles as well as bullets once collected, otherwise you will not be able to fire missiles and you will only be able to fire bullets. Furthermore, the firing cooling down mechanic is a system which prevents you from over firing your bullets when you have fired too many bullets, so therefore you must wait until your weapon has cooled down before you carry on firing more bullets.

                            <p>Dune Prison is a 3D first person shooter (FPS) game, which I developed using the Unity game engine and the C# programming language. In addition, the game is tank based and incorporates tanks, for when it comes to gameplay. The aim of the game is to destroy all of the enemy tanks by using the crosshair, in order to escape the dune prison. Once you have destroyed all of the tanks, you should be able to escape through the walls of the dune prison. However, you must be careful as the enemy tanks are controlled via artificial intelligence (AI) and could therefore destroy you. In addition, you have five lives and for each tank you destroy, you gain a score of one hundred points. If you gain a score of 900 points or more, its only then that you are free and can escape the dune prison. The controls for this game are keyboard, mouse and Xbox 360 controls, which enable you to have an effective gaming experience.</p>

                            <p>Furthermore, I incorporated virtual reality (VR) within this game which makes the gameplay efficient and also realistic. Therefore, you are able to attach your smartphone to a Google Cardboard headset in order to play. For the enemy AI, I have incorporated three different types of tanks which do various different actions, in order to destroy the player tank. The first enemy tank follows you, shoots bullets at you and evades when you fire bullets at the tank. The second enemy tank follows you, shoots missiles at you and has a patrol point which it patrols you from. The third enemy tank follows you and also fires missiles as well as bullets at you, which makes it challenging to destroy this enemy tank. All of these enemy tanks can only do these actions, if you are at a certain range near them. For example, if you are very near an enemy tank then it will follow and shoot bullets at you, however, if you are far away from an enemy tank then it will not follow and shoot bullets at you.

Some drivers will not be as efficient as others, in terms of the FPS and therefore the FPS will not be as good. Choosing different drivers will enable you to change the FPS of the game scene, which can improve the way your using the game scene in terms of the graphics.
